##Jim's Tic Tac Toe Game

This is Jim O'Neal's code submission for the 8th-Light apprenticeship program, which involved re-building an existing Tic Tac Toe game that runs in the terminal.

Some of the requirements of the game are:

  1. The game should handle bad user input.
  2. The computer player should play at a difficulty level of “hard”, meaning the computer player cannot be beaten.  Currently the computer could be beaten in certain situations.
  3. The game play left a lot to be desired. The user messages are lacking. They’re unclear. It’s confusing to see the spot that’s selected and the board all on the screen. It’s easy to get lost in what’s happening. It’s weird the way the computer picks its spot without notifying the user.
  4. Allow the user to choose the game type (human v. human, computer v. computer, human v. computer).
  5. Allow the user to choose which player goes first.
  6. Allow the user to choose with what “symbol” the players will mark their selections on the board (traditionally it’s “X” and “O”).
